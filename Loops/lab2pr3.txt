a) Hackers being regarding as the internet’s immune system is a valid point. They are often the ones that find security flaws in programs that people use all the time. Without them, these flaws would be free to exploit and would go unnoticed until someone took advantage of them. b) It depends on what the hackers do. Obviously, if a hacker broke into a bank and stole a great sum of money, the law should respond accordingly. Hacking in the name of social experiments, on the other hand, should not be punished so liberally. If it is for the greater good, hacking should be met without punishment. c) The main positive effect of hacking is that it forces companies to clean up their security standards, ultimately making people safer in the cyber environment. If data breaches within companies never meet the public eye, people would never know whether or not their data is at risk. However, this public awareness would not be necessary if people did not use hacking with malicious intent.
