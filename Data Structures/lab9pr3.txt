a) My day to day life would change if I had an affordable 3D printer because I would be able to make anything I wanted in an instant. I could make a cool case for my phone, a pen and pencil holder for my desk, or coasters for my coffee table. 3D printing enables complex objects to be made relatively cheaply. Economies of scale do not apply as much with 3D printed materials as they are cheap to make to begin with. Specialized machines do not need to be manufactured or changed to produce completely different products. b) If 3D printing becomes common, the world of manufacturing will be completely changed. Instead of going to the store to buy household items, items can be downloaded from the internet and printed in an instant. The world of trade will change as many things will no longer need to be shipped physically but can instead arrive digitally into people’s hands. c) Numerous computer science problems occur in 3D printing. For instance, software has to be designed that allows the 3D printer to run. A printer cannot print anything without software driving it. Software also has to be designed so products can be virtualized and then printed into reality. d) Problems that we have covered in this class that appear in a 3D printing context include bugs. Something as complex as a 3D printer can be prone to software bugs that prevent the printer from running properly. Another issue facing 3D printers is that of hardware. Complex hardware can be prone to failure and needs to be maintained meticulously for it to work properly.
