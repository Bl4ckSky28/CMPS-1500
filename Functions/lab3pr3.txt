Gaming technology can be applied to multiple areas of the real world besides gaming applications. For example, the army has virtual gun ranges that utilize real life firearms. They register on screen displaying a virtual world of enemies and friendlies that trainees have to learn to distinguish between. This type of training clearly indicates how gaming technology can be used in military applications. Gaming technology has also been used in an educational setting. It has been used to augment teaching finger placement and fast typing in grade school children. Games can be used to help improve typing speed among other things. One last example is that gaming technology can be used to improved communication. Oculus rift can be used to revolutionize the way people communicate. By using them, you could be face to face with anyone in the world, making communication easier. These are only same of the ways that gaming technology has creeped into real life applications, but ultimately more innovations are bound to come in the future.
