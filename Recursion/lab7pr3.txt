a) Identity theft is a problem because it can have lasting effects that persist even after the stolen information is regained. Thieves could have opened new accounts or committed a crime in the victim’s name. It can be a long process to have these misdeeds removed from the victim’s record. Besides having your identity stolen, other forms of personal data can be misused. Personal information can be used to track you down. Where you live can be quickly revealed over the internet. Social media information can be used to reveal personal photos or information, especially if accounts are not secured in the correct way. b) Posting photos on the internet applies to me. I have not turned off the geolocation feature. Even though posting photos reveal the geolocation of where the photo was taken, I believe that this information can be hard to find unless you know where to look for it. The common person does not have the knowledge, skill, or desire to find out someone’s personal information. That being said, it is nearly impossible to completely avoid exposing personal data. One would have to go completely off the grid to prevent themselves from having a digital footprint. Cellphones are only one way of tracking down a person’s whereabouts. Public records, credit cards, and other things can say a lot about a person. Data collection is simply too ingrained into everyone’s lives for someone to be able to remove themselves completely and still be a functioning member of society.
