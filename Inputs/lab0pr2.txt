They might not be the same as a computer algorithm, but they still follow a precise sequence of steps to achieve a desired outcome, such as the splitting of a cell in the human body.  b) Algorithms shape our world in a number of ways. For example, algorithms determine the shortest distance between points in mapping applications. They are used in powerful search engines to make navigating the web easier. Facial recognition algorithms in your phone allow it to recognize your face and unlock itself. Algorithms are everywhere in daily life whether we realize or not. c) In these examples, it would be fairly straightforward to determine if the algorithm did not work properly. Maps would not have been able to compute a route between the two points, or it would have not computed the most efficient route. If a search engine does not work as intended, people would not find what they are looking for on the web. Your phone would not unlock for your face if the algorithm was not working properly and did not recognize you. All of these are indicators of a problem.
