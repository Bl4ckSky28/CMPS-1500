a) To overcome the fact that people who translate the texts are not professional translators and are beginning learners, Duolingo combines inputs from multiple people to construct the finalized translated text. This approach can be applied to other areas of life, such as translating business documents that need to be used internationally. b) Other products that came out of online collaboration of volunteers on the internet include video game testing. Studios release unfinished version of their games over the internet for people to play for free, so they can receive feedback that they can incorporate into the final product. Another product that comes out of online collaboration is the website theprose.com. It is a coauthored collection of poetry and prose that people can contribute to. People can upload their content to the website where others can comment and contribute to it. I have not taken part in any of these initiatives. c) One advantage that connecting computers to the internet has brought to humanity is the implications of social media. People are more connected now than they ever were before as it is easier to stay connected over vast distances. Additionally, internet commerce has changed the consumer market. Consumers can now purchase virtually anything without leaving the comfort of their homes. Lastly, as a student, the internet has allowed people to access vast amounts of information at the tip of their fingertips. Anything can be googled with ease.
