The diversity of user products will often affect the way the product has to be designed. These differences often affect the way applications and devices should be designed. There are multiple scenarios in which user diversity will have to be considered in the design of the final product. One of which is whether the user uses the metric or imperial measurement system. A program may not work under a different measurement system as the units are different. Miles is different from kilometers and so on. Another scenario involves user language. As languages are different around the world, a program used internationally needs to be understood in multiple languages. A program that only gives prompts in English would not be useful for someone who only speaks Chinese. Computer knowledge also must be considered. Programs must match the knowledge level of their users. A sophisticated program with lots of required inputs may not be useful for a person that does not know how to work a mouse. For one last example, age must be taken into account. A program that is meant to be used for adults must be designed with adults in mind. Inputs and outputs would have to match their maturity level.
